# Task Management Application

This is a **Task Management** web application that allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks efficiently. It is developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with data persistence implemented through **localStorage** to store user tasks directly in the browser.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Users can create tasks by providing a task name and description.
- **View Tasks**: A list of all added tasks is dynamically displayed on the page.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage, so they persist even when the page is refreshed.
- **Edit and Delete Tasks**: Users can modify or remove tasks as needed.
- **User Authentication (Placeholder)**: The application tracks logged-in users using the `userLoggedIn` variable to personalize the task management experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Used for structuring the web pages.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Used for task management functionality, localStorage interaction, and dynamic DOM manipulation.
- **Bootstrap 5**: Integrated for responsive design and enhanced UI components (optional).
